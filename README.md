# Simple-Perceptron
Written for 2023 Summer CSC207H1Y (Software Design) at the University of Toronto. Assignment: AI-Assisted Design Exercise. The code written here is based on code generated by ChatGPT. My understanding is that the goal of this exercise was to give the students a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT as a programming tool. I did a simple linear perceptron purely because this assignment seemed to allow us to write very simple programs and it seemed fitting to do an early ML algorithm for the AI-assisted design exercise.
